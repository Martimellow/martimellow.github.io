# Vehkran
The Vehkran are the half man half wolf species of MagusTerra.
 
There are two primary types of Vehkran, the Civilized and the Feral. Vehkran naturally accumulates a substance in their body known as Sangvehk, there is an individual specific threshold for all Vehkran that determines how much sangvehk it takes for them to turn feral. Once they are turned feral they can regain consciousness by lowering their sangvehk levels but it is very difficult to accomplish this because a feral Vehkra doesn't try to reduce their sangvehk levels, so the burden is placed upon others to subdue and lower the feral's levels.

# Basic Information
## Genetics and Reproduction
Vehkra can either be reproduced through birth or they can be transformed from a Vehkran Bite. When a Vehkra bites someone they can release Sangvehk through glands in their fangs which if left untreated will turn the individual into a Vehkra. Typically it takes a few days for a Vehkra bite to cause a transformation as the Sangvehk needs to build up in the body but it depends on the lunar cycle as sangvehk is more potent during an enlarged Vibrant Moon. 
 
If the bitten individual is treated with Vehkmoss before the sangvehk accumulates too much they can avoid transforming into a Vehkra. But once the sangvehk has reached a certain limit the individual will transform into a Vehkra and be stuck that way for the rest of their life constantly managing their sangvehk levels to ensure they don't become feral.

## Behaviour
### Feral Vehkran
The feral Vehkran have very little control over their actions. They effectively behave like wolves. There is still a pack mentality and a power hierarchy with the alpha being at the top but their consciousness doesn't go much beyond that. Their behaviour is however tied in with the two moons that orbit Magusterra. When the Dull Moon is full and or closer to Magusterra the Vehkra tend to be more docile and are easier to turn back to Civilized Vehkra. Hover when the Vibrant Moon  is full and or closer to Magusterra the Feral Vehkran are riled up. They still tend not to go out hunting for individuals to turn but if they see somebody they will be driven by instinct to bite and turn them into Vehkra.
 
### Civilized Vehkran
Civilized Vehkran aren't much different from the average human, they are completely in control of their own decisions though they are still affected by the Lunar Cycl. When the Dull Moon Comes around they tend to be calmer and less agitated. Where as when the Vibrant Moon comes around they feel stronger, less tolerant and more aggressive. Not enough to make them act drastically different but they can just be slightly more aggressive.

# Additional Information
## Geographic Origin and Distribution
The Vehkran, both civilzied and feral can be found all over Magusterra, they tend to reside in more forested areas but civilized vehkran occasionaly live in cities.
Civilization and Culture

## Interspecies Relations and Assumptions
Vehkran are generally shunned from society. Most human-like races don't distinguish between the civilized and feral Vehkran and don't trust they are safe around the civilized Vehkran. Few still live in major cities or particularly accepting small villages, but the vast majority keep to their own packs.
 
The bestial races of Magusterra are much more understanding and accepting of the Vehkran. In fact many of them such as the Efos and Bezmertan have joined the civilized Vehkran on their never-ending quest to hunt down and revert feral Vehkran.
