# Sangvehk
Sangvehk is a substance in [Vehkran](./vehkran.md) blood that influences how feral a vehkra is. Upon being bitten the Sangvehk starts to grow and multiply. If it spreads enough then an individual will permanently turn into a Vehkra. If it is treated quickly enough the body can fight off all the Sangvehk preventing this transformation. However once the transformation is made it is permanent. Once one is fully transformed into a Vehkra either by transmission or birth the Sangvehk is produced by the body and the only thing to do is to try to manage your levels, you can't remove it completely. It is still critical that the levels are managed because after reaching a certain level of Sangvehk, that is different for each Vehkra, the Vehkra will turn feral. At this point the Vehkra no longer has direct control over it's faculties and is lead by instinct alone. If the sangvehk levels are reduced below the individuals feral threshold then they will regain consciousness. Sangvehk is produce by a Vehkra body but it is affected by Lunar energy. The [Vibrant Moon](../cosmos/vibrantMoon.md) increase the potency and production of sangvehk making Vehkra more aggressive and at a higher risk of turning feral. The [Dull Moon](../cosmos/dullMoon.md) decreases the potency and slows the production of sangvehk making Vehkra more agreeable and safer from the risk of turning feral.

## Transmission & Vectors
Sangvehk is primarily transmitted through a [Vehkra's](./vehkran.md) fangs during a bite. However it resides in the blood stream so if contaminated blood gets mixed with an individuals blood the Sangvehk will start to grow/multiply.

## Treatment
The only way to manage Sangvehk levels is through [Vehkmoss](../zones/howlingTimber/vehkmoss.md).
