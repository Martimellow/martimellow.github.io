# Dull Moon
The Dull Moon is the lesser visible of the two moons that orbit Magusterra, giving off a faint orange glow. Some organizations like the Lunar Monks and species like the [Vehkran](..//races/vehkran.md) draw on the Dull Moons energy. It is believed that the Dull Moon gives off a peaceful energy. 
 
## A Deeper Understanding
The Dull Moon does in fact give off a peaceful, harmonious, life-giving energy. It is transferring life energy from itself to Magusterra leaving it dull and barren but giving energy to Magusterra. The moon is known as Enlarged when it is either fuller or closer to Magusterra in its orbit cycle resulting in a stronger energy-transferring effect and it's known as Shrunken when it's shrouded or farther away.
