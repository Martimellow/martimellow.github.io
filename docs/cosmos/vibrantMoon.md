# Vibrant Moon
The Vibrant Moon is the more visible of the two moons that orbit Magusterra, giving off a bright white glow with a faint green tint. Some organizations like the Lunar Monks and species like the [Vehkran](../races/vehkran.md) draw on the Vibrant Moons energy. It is believed that the Vibrant Moon gives off an aggressive energy. 
 
## A Deeper Understanding
The Vibrant Moon does in fact give off an aggressive, destructive, life-stealing energy. It is siphoning life energy from Magusterra to bolster itself leaving it bright and lush. The moon is known as Enlarged when it is either fuller or closer to Magusterra in its orbit cycle resulting in a stronger energy-transferring effect and it's known as Shrunken when it's shrouded or farther away.
