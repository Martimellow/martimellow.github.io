# Vehkmoss
A mossy herb with small brown flowers on it that grow ever so faintly. This moss is used by the [Vehkran](../../races/vehkran.md) to keep their levels of [Sangvehk](../../races/sangvehk.md) in check. Vehkmoss draws on energy from the Dull Moon so when the Dull moon is enlarged the vehkmoss glows more vibrantly, grows quicker and has a greater effect on sangvehk.
